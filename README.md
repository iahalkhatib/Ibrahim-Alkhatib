### 🧭 About

Welcome — this is my **AI & Systems Innovation Portfolio**, a personal hub for the work I’m building at the intersection of **business, technology, and human-AI systems**.  

My background spans **program management, analytics, automation, and AI**, with an emphasis on making data and intelligence *usable* and *impactful*.  
I focus on creating frameworks and solutions that combine **technical depth with strategic clarity** — systems that make humans faster, not replace them.  

Currently, I’m developing **Aggccelerate**, an ecosystem of modular AI applications and robotics projects built to redefine how people interact with technology.
